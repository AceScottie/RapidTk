- #time_it -> a wrapping logging function designed to test the execution time of funcitions
	- ```python
	  import logging
	  log = logging.getLogger('rapidTk') # gets the rapidTk log
	  log.setLevel(99) # sets the log level to verbose
	  @time_it #requires level 100 (verbose) to display time_it results
	  def some_func():
	  	print("hello world")
	      
	  some_func()
	  >>>hello world
	  >>>0000-00-00 00:00:00,000 rapidTk rTkUtils.py(19) - Timer for <some_func.some_func> finished in 0.000017900
	  >>>[Finished]
	  log.setLevel(98) #if level < 100 then timeing information is hidden
	  some_func()
	  >>>hello world
	  >>>[Finished]
	  ```
- #_UniqueIdentifiers -> uses uuid4 to generate unique identifiers and stores used uuids into itsself as a list
- #coord -> a simple x, y positional vector
- #clipboard -> manages the windows clipboard using Win32API rather than pythonic cross-platform varients.
- #SingletonMeta -> recalls instance of a class if it already has an existing instance rather than creating a new instance
- #widegBase -> base methods for all rTk Widgets
- #cache -> a simple cache wrapper to store the results of a previous execution of a method if the input values are the same.
- #simpledate -> simplifies the datetime object by setting time to 0
- #inline_layout -> pass **kwargs that contain both widget kwords and layout kwords and it will split them out and determin (if possible) which of pack, grid or place layouts you are trying to use based on the layout kwords.
- #RepeatedTimer -> repeating thread that repeats after interval
